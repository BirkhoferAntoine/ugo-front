# UGO Front End

## Overview
This project is a React Typescript application leveraging GSAP for animations, axios for making API requests, and Material-UI (MUI) for styling. It's designed to work in conjunction with the UGO Back End Symfony application. The application showcases a dynamic user interface with responsive design and interactive elements.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that the UGO Back End Symfony application is set up in a parent directory relative to this project for optimal integration.

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get the front-end application running:

1. **Installing Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project's root directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Starting the React Application**:
   To launch the React development server, execute:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Starting the Symfony API**:
   If you have the Symfony API in the parent directory, you can start it directly from this project using:
   ```bash
   npm run symfony
   ```

4. **Running Tests**:
   This project uses Vitest for testing. Run the test suite with:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Key Features
- **React Typescript**: Leverages the power of Typescript for type safety and better developer experience.
- **GSAP Animations**: Includes smooth and engaging animations for enhanced user interactions.
- **Axios Requests**: Manages API calls efficiently and cleanly.
- **Vitest**: Incorporates modern testing practices to ensure code reliability.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Utilizes MUI components for a sleek and responsive design.
